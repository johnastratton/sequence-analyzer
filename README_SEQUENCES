sequences.pl
Analyzes sequences of numbers, and reports the detected sequences.

Usage: 
sequence_anomalies.pl <file containing sequence> <Display format string>

Reads contents from argument 1, and attempts to interpret the contents 
as a list of incrementing numbers, one on each line, displaying the 
contents as a compressed set of continuous subsequences.
The format string is the preferred format for printing numbers in the 
report for this file. 

Requirements:
* File path and format string arguments are both required.
  - usage message printed in error case
* File contents are assumed to be in ascending sorted order
  - Keep in mind that the sort utility sorts lexographically by default: you 
    probably will want to use the -n flag when preparing input

Features:
* Matches first number on each line, ignoring other characters
  - In herbarium specimens, accession numbers often come with an 
    herbarium code prepended.  This feature ignores the herbarium code, but 
    requires that each line be treated as its own number.
* Formats output according to command-line argument
  - Because herbarium codes are stripped out for numerical analysis, this 
    feature provides the user with the mechanism to add them (or any other 
    preferred formatting) back in.  For well-defined results, the format 
    string must contain only one integer placeholder (%d variant) and no 
    other placeholders. When typing in a terminal, enclosing quotes are 
    recommended.
* Duplicate entries are considered the start of a new subsequence.
  - Output of the format:
    A - B
    B - C

      Means that there are two copies of B in the file, one of which 
    ends a contiguous sequence beginning with A, the other beginning 
    a contiguous sequence ending at C.  The two sequences are not 
    combined into a single A - C sequence because of the duplicated 
    B entry.
