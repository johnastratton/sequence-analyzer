This project was created to automatically analyze database entries and 
filesystem contents for herbarium specimens.  Finding the missing numbers 
in a collection is labor-intensive work to do by hand when there are 
thousands of entries.  This program works on the assumption that the natural 
order of things is an ascending sequence of integers.  One of the two 
included scripts compresses these sequences into ranges that are easier 
to understand by a person.  The other does the reverse task, and prints 
deviations from a standard range.

This project is essentially encapsulated in two Perl scripts.  Please 
see the README files README_ANOMALIES and README_SEQUENCES for more 
details on each.
