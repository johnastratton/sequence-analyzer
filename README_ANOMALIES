sequence_anomalies.pl
Analyzes sequences of numbers, and reports anomalies from a standard 
incrementing sequence.  

Usage: 
sequence_anomalies.pl <file containing sequence> <Display format string>

Reads contents from argument 1, and attempts to interpret the contents 
as a list of incrementing numbers, one on each line, displaying deviations 
from the expected sequence.  The first detected entry is interpretated as the 
starting point of the sequence.  The format string is the 
preferred format for printing numbers in the report for this file. 

Requirements:
* File path and format string arguments are both required.
  - usage message printed in error case
* File contents are assumed to be in ascending sorted order
  - Keep in mind that the sort utility sorts lexographically by default: you 
    probably will want to use the -n flag when preparing input

Features:
* Matches first number on each line, ignoring other characters
  - In herbarium specimens, accession numbers often come with an 
    herbarium code prepended.  This feature ignores the herbarium code, but 
    requires that each line be treated as its own number.
* Formats output according to command-line argument
  - Because herbarium codes are stripped out for numerical analysis, this 
    feature provides the user with the mechanism to add them (or any other 
    preferred formatting) back in.  For well-defined results, the format 
    string must contain only one integer placeholder (%d variant) and no 
    other placeholders. When typing in a terminal, enclosing quotes are 
    recommended.
* Detects missing numbers and ranges
  - Single missing numbers are listed as "Missing: <formatted number>"
  - Multiple missing numbers in a row are listed as a single missing range
* Detects duplicate entries
  - As input is assumed to be sorted, entries can not be out of order, but 
    duplicates are detected and reported, with a note of the number of 
    identical entires seen for that number.
* Detects multi-entry numbers with minor differentiators
  - Some herbarium entries contain multiple parts, typically in the format 
    N.1, N.2, N.3 for number N.  These are considered "normal" rather than 
    "aberrant" in many cases, but would be seen as duplicates without this 
    feature (because N is the matched number for each line.)  This feature 
    separates multi-entry items out with the prefix "Multi-entry:", and 
    adds the comment "(with noncontiguous minors)" if the minor numbers 
    are not themselves an integer sequence starting from 1.
* Missing number total
  - At the end of processing, the script will print the total number of 
    entries that were missing from the natural sequence, with the prefix 
    "Total missing: ".  The number here is not formatted with the command 
    line format argument.
